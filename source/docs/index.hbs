<p>You may think that this is just yet an other charting library. But Chartist.js is the product of

of other great charting libraries but after using them there were always tweaks you would have wished for that were not
  included.</p>

    <h4>Configuration overrides based on media queries</h4>
    <p>Configuring different chart behaviour for various media is made simple with an override mechanism. The priority of
    the override mechanism is based on order of specification of the matching media queries.</p>
    <p class="browser-hint">For IE9 you need to use a matchMedia polyfill. You should take a look at
      <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/">Paul Irish's matchMedia polyfill</a>.</p>

    <p>With the clear separation of concerns within Chartist.js you're able to style your charts with CSS in @media queries.
     However, sometimes it requires to also control the behaviour of your charts depending on the media. For this purpose
    Chartist.js provides you with a simple configuration override mechanism based on media queries.</p>
