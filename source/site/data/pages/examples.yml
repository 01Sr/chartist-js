                   This advanced example uses a line chart to draw a scatter diagram. The data object is created
                   with a functional style random mechanism. There is a mobile first responsive configuration using
                   the responsive options to show less labels on small screens.

                    A bi-plar bar chart with a range limit set with low and high. There is also an interpolation

          classes: ct-golden-section
          intro: >
                    This example makes use of label interpolation and the seriesBarDistance property that allows you
                    to make bars overlap over each other. This then can be used to use the avialable space on mobile better.

          intro: >
                    This pie chart is configured with custom labels specified in the data object. On desktop we use the labelOffset
                    property to offset the labels from the center. Also labelDirection can be used to control the direction
                    in which the labels are expanding.
