Chartist.js is a responsive charting library built with SVG. There are hundreds of nice charting libraries already
out there, but they are either:

* not responsive
* use the wrong technologies for illustration (canvas)
* are not flexible enough while keeping the configuration simple
* are not friendly to your own code
* are not friendly to designers
* more annoying things

That's why we have started Chartist.js and our goal is to solve all of the above issues.

## Example site

You can visit this Site http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/ which is in fact a build of the current project.
We are still in alpha version 0.0.5 and there are a lot of things to do until we are production ready (see version notes)

## Version notes

We are currently on 0.0.5 alpha and we are far away from a production ready version. Your help is needed! Please contribute
to the project if you like the idea and the concept and help us to bring nice looking responsive open-source charts
to the masses.

### Important missing stuff

1. Cross-browser support (currently IE 9- is not tested). We should support all major browsers that support inline SVG down to IE9.
2. Better separation of the library to the demo site
3. Jasmine Tests!
4. Better interfaces to the library (i.e. jQuery with data-* attributes for configuration), Angular.js directive etc.
5. Other charts types (bar chart, donut etc.)

## Contribution

We are looking for people who share the idea of having a simple, flexible charting library that is responsive and uses
modern and future prove technologies. The goal of this project is to create a responsive charting library where developers
have their joy in using it and designers love it because of the designing flexibility they have.
